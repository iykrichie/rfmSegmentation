# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

*RFM Analysis: Scoring and Ranking Customer Value*

*RFM* is a strategy for analyzing and estimating the value of a customer, based on three data points: Recency (How recently did the customer make a purchase?), Frequency (How often do they purchase), and Monetary Value (How much do they spend?).  This is a popular marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. The system assigns each customer numerical scores based on these factors to provide an objective analysis. 

RFM analysis is based on the marketing adage that 
>"80% of your business revenue comes from 20% of your customers." - Pareto's Principle

An RFM analysis evaluates which customers are of highest and lowest value to an organization based on purchase recency, frequency, and monetary value, in order to reasonably predict which customers are more likely to make purchases again in the future.

The results is an output that assigns every customer a value score and a desciptive segement name.

I have borrowed this analysis which is mostly used in B2C's, ecommerce and subscription based businesses, and applied it to banking domain, buy adapting the datapoints accordingly.

The scope of this analysis starts by observing 6-months transaction data for retail customers of a financial institution (retail bank).

The transactioin records shows entry for every transaction done by every customer across numerous transaction channels. This treats every transaction by unique customers also aggregates transactions for customers with different accounts.

- **Recency:** How recently did the customer make a purchase? If they made a purchase recently, the likelihood of them making another purchase is high. However, if the customer hasn't made a purchase in a while, you may need to nurture them with new promotional offers or even reintroduce your brand.

- **Frequency:** How often does the customer make purchases? If they purchase often, you'll know their spending habits and preferences, but if they make one purchase and never return, they could be a good candidate for a customer satisfaction survey.

- **Monetary Value:** How much do your customers spend per purchase? Don't get too caught up on the number here, though â€” all purchases are valuable. However, the first two letters in the RFM acronym can be visualized more clearly by this third component. If they've made many recent purchases at a high price point, you've got a returning customer that can turn into a brand loyalist.

These three factors of the RFM model can be used to reasonably predict how likely (or unlikely) it is that a customer will re-purchase from a company.
